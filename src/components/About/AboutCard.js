          Hi! Iâ€™m a fresh graduate in Informatics Engineering with a strong passion for turning data into meaningful insights and intelligent solutions. 
          My journey in tech has led me to explore Machine Learning and Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras), where Iâ€™ve built AI models such as CNN, LSTM, 
          and even experimented with Generative AI.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond modeling, I love making data accessible and engaging through interactive dashboards and web apps â€” from Tableau and Power BI to Streamlit. 
          During my internship at PTPN VII, I worked on a data visualization chatbot that brought data to life and made insights easier to understand.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am deeply passionate about digging into the meaning behind every piece of data and transforming it into valuable insights that matter. 
          For me, data is not just numbers â€” itâ€™s a story waiting to be told.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m always excited about projects that combine AI, data, and creativity to solve real-world problems and create impact. ðŸš€
